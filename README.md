# notion-html-export-fixer

The purpose of this repository is quite simple. For those using [Notion](https://www.notion.so "Notion, the all in one workspace") to export it's pages to HTML, 
it is common to experience broken links when the trying to reach a page which is far from the root.
Running the three functions provided in index against the generated folder should fix this, as long as the url characters limit isn't exceeded for the page name itself.
